## Welcome to IT0075 - Python for Many Uses at Sierra College!

My name is Jared Amalong and I will be your instructor for the semester.  During our time together, we will create many Python projects.  You can proudly share these projects to the GitHub community and showcase your projects on your portfolio website created in GitHub Pages.
